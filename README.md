# About the Schemas

These are the reference schemas for the Apato project.  They are (to be) used in the project tests.

The following files are to be derivative from items in this directory.  (Sadly it's beyond my Python skill to make these automatically derivative.)

- `/catalog/models.py`
- `/catalog/schema.py`


The following files are to be verified against these schemas.

- `/catalog/fixtures/loaddata/*.json`
- `/catalog/fixtures/dumpdata/*.json`
